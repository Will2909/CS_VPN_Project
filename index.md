## Instructions Below

Fist we must create a Droplet in DigitalOcean.
When creating your droplet, choose Ubuntu 20.04 and whatever specs you want.
Select the data ceneter you wish to use.

Once we creat the droplet, we will run our commands in the droplet console.
To find the droplet console, look at the column on the left hand side and click on Droplets.
Select the droplet you wish to use then click on the Acess page.
Once inside the Access page, there will be an icon that says "Launch Droplet Console"
Now you will be in the locaiton where you can run the following commands.


### Install Docker

First we need to install the tools for the project:

```markdown
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Will2909/CS_VPN_Project/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
