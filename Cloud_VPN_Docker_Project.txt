First we must create a Droplet in DigitalOcean.
When creating your droplet, choose Ubuntu 20.04 and which ever specs you want.
Select the data center you wish to use.

Once we create the droplet, we will run our commands in the droplet console.
To find the droplet console, look at the column on the left hand side and click on Droplets.
Select the droplet your wish to use then click on the Access page.
Once inside the Access page, there will be a icon that says "Launch Droplet Console"
Now you will be in the location where you can run the following commands.

Next we must install docker.
First we need to install the tools for the project:
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y

Then we must add the docker key:
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

Next we must add the docker repository:
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

Now we must switch it to the correct repository:
sudo apt install docker-ce -y

Now just install Docker-Compose:
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Finally set the permission for docker-compose:
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Now we will setup wireguard. 
We will run all of the commands in the droplet console.

First we must a directory for wireguard and config.
mkdir -p ~/wireguard/
mkdir -p ~/wireguard/config/

Next we must create the docker-compose.yml file and edit it.
I used vim, but feel free to use your text editor of choice.
vim ~/wireguard/docker-compose.yml

Now that you are editing the docker-compose.yml file, you must copy and paste the content below:

version: '3.8'
services:
  wireguard:
    container_name: wireguard
    image: linuxserver/wireguard
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/Chicago
      - SERVERURL=x.x.x.x
      - SERVERPORT=51820
      - PEERS=Phone
      - PEERDNS=auto
      - INTERNAL_SUBNET=10.0.0.0
    ports:
      - 51820:51820/udp
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./config/
        target: /config/
      - type: bind
        source: /lib/modules
        target: /lib/modules
    restart: always
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - SYS_MODULE
    sysctls:
      - net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1

Now go and edit the following:
Set the timezone (TZ) to your timezone.
Insert the IP address for your server on the SERVERURL line.
Also, for myself, I only have my Phone as a peer but if you desire more then add them on the PEERS line.

Next you will want to navagiate to your wireguard directory:
cd ~/wireguard/

Then you will start wireguard:
docker-compose up -d

If you want to connect your phone to wireguard then download the wireguard app from the IOS or Playstore.
Once installed run this command:
docker-compose logs -f wireguard

A QR code will be generated that you will be able to scan. Once scanned, you will be able to use the VPN.
